    <h4>A Canticle</h4>
    
    <h4>The Apostles' Creed</h4>

    <p><em>Officiant and People together, all standing</em></p>
    
    <p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creator of heaven and earth;</br> 
    I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit</br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and born of the Virgin Mary.</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suffered under Pontius Pilate,</br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was crucified, died, and was buried.</br>  
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He descended to the dead.</br>  
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day he rose again.</br>  
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ascended into heaven,</br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</br> 
    I believe in the Holy Spirit,</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the holy catholic Church,</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the communion of saints,</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the forgiveness of sins</br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the resurrection of the body,</br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the life everlasting. Amen.</p>
