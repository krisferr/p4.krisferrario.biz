Daily Prayer App

Description of my application:
This application has essentially two functions first it provides the content of three prayer services. The content is generated by date or by random selection. Some of the content is provided through links that are generate by date. This is due to that material being under copyright and thus not allowing me to put it directly on this site. This part of the site is fully functional without the user signing in.

The second function of this site is a social network, similar to the micro blog, that allows people to share their prayer requests. They can follow others. As well as indicate whether or noth they are praying for them. They can also tag their requests as being urgent or if their prayer has been ansewred.

List of Features:
-> Generate three daily services (morning & evening prayer and comlpine) using the date given by the user.
-> Allows logged in users to communicate specfic prayer requests with one another.

There are two aspects of my application that are being managed by JavaScript. The first is the selection of a date on the main page that allows a user to change the date of service that is geenrated on the following pages. The second is a user reponces to the requests page. Users can change the color of requests to indicate impotrance or if it has been answered. They also can click to idicate that they are praying (similar to a like feature on facebook).
