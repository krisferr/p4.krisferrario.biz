            <br>
            <h5>All stand</h5>
            <br>
                <p><em>Officiant:</em>    Lord, open our lips.</p> 
                <p><em>People:</em>      And our mouth shall proclaim your praise.</p> 
            
                <p><em>Officiant and People:</em> Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: as 
                it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. <em>Amen. Alleluia.</em></p>
