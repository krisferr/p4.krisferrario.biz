    <h4>The Apostles' Creed</h4>
    <br>
        <p><em>Officiant and People together, all standing</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creator of heaven and earth;<br> 
        I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit<br> 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and born of the Virgin Mary.<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br> 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was crucified, died, and was buried.<br>  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He descended to the dead.<br>  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day he rose again.<br>  
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ascended into heaven,<br> 
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br> 
        I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the holy catholic Church,<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the communion of saints,<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the forgiveness of sins<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the resurrection of the body,<br> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the life everlasting. Amen.</p>
