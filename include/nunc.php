    <p4>The Song of Simeon &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Nunc Dimittis</em></p4> 
    
    <p>Luke 2:29-32</p> 
    
    <p>Lord, you now have set your servant free * </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to go in peace as you have promised; </br>
    For these eyes of mine have seen the Savior, * </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom you have prepared for all the world to see: </br>
    A Light to enlighten the nations, * </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the glory of your people Israel.</br></p> 
    
    <p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: * </br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.</br></p>
