Be our light in the darkness, O Lord, and in your great mercy 
defend us from all perils and dangers of this night; for the
love of your only Son, our Savior Jesus Christ. Amen.

Be present, O merciful God, and protect us through the hours
of this night, so that we who are wearied by the changes and
chances of this life may rest in your eternal changelessness; 
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Look down, O Lord, from your heavenly throne, and
illumine this night with your celestial brightness; that by
night as by day your people may glorify your holy Name;
through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

Visit this place, O Lord, and drive far from it all snares of the 
enemy; let your holy angels dwell with us to preserve us in
peace; and let your blessing be upon us always; through Jesus 
Christ our Lord. Amen.

A Collect for Saturdays

We give you thanks, O God, for revealing your Son Jesus
Christ to us by the light of his resurrection: Grant that as we 
sing your glory at the close of this day, our joy may abound
in the morning as we celebrate the Paschal mystery; through
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
