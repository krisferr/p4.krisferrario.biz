    <h4><em>Venite</em>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Psalm 95:1-7</h4>
    
    <p>Come, let us sing to the Lord; * <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let us shout for joy to the Rock of our salvation. <br>
    Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving * <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and raise a loud shout to him with psalms.<br></p>
    
    <p>For the Lord is a great God, * <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a great King above all gods. <br>
    In his hand are the caverns of the earth, * <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the heights of the hills are his also. <br>
    The sea is his, for he made it, * <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his hands have molded the dry land.<br> </p>
    
    <p>Come, let us bow down, and bend the knee, * <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and kneel before the Lord our Maker. <br>
    For he is our God, <br>
    and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. * <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that today you would hearken to his voice!<br></p>
    
    <p>Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: *<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.<br></p>
