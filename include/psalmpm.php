<h4>Psalm 4 <em>Cum invocarem</em></h4>

1    Answer me when I call, O God, defender of my cause; *
         you set me free when I am hard-pressed;
         have mercy on me and hear my prayer.

2    "You mortals, how long will you dishonor my glory; *
         how long will you worship dumb idols
         and run after false gods?"

3    Know that the LORD does wonders for the faithful; *
         when I call upon the LORD, he will hear me.

4    Tremble, then, and do not sin; *
         speak to your heart in silence upon your bed.

5    Offer the appointed sacrifices *
         and put your trust in the LORD.

6    Many are saying,
         "Oh, that we might see better times!" *
         Lift up the light of your countenance upon us, O LORD.

7    You have put gladness in my heart, *
         more than when grain and wine and oil increase.

8    I lie down in peace; at once I fall asleep; *
         for only you, LORD, make me dwell in safety.

      Psalm 31 In te, Domine, speravi

1    In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge;
         let me never be put to shame: *
         deliver me in your righteousness.

2    Incline your ear to me; *
         make haste to deliver me.

3    Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe, 
         for you are my crag and my stronghold; *
         for the sake of your Name, lead me and guide me.

4    Take me out of the net that they have secretly set for me, *
         for you are my tower of strength.

5    Into your hands I commend my spirit, *
         for you have redeemed me,
         O LORD, O God of truth.

      Psalm 91 Qui habitat 

1    He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High *
         abides under the shadow of the Almighty.

2    He shall say to the LORD,
         "You are my refuge and my stronghold, *
         my God in whom I put my trust."

3    He shall deliver you from the snare of the hunter *
         and from the deadly pestilence.

4    He shall cover you with his pinions,
      and you shall find refuge under his wings; *
         his faithfulness shall be a shield and buckler.

5    You shall not be afraid of any terror by night, *
         nor of the arrow that flies by day;

6    Of the plague that stalks in the darkness, *
         nor of the sickness that lays waste at mid-day.

7    A thousand shall fall at your side
      and ten thousand at your right hand, *
         but it shall not come near you.

8    Your eyes only have to behold *
         to see the reward of the wicked.

9    Because you have made the LORD your refuge, *
         and the Most High your habitation,

10    There shall no evil happen to you, *
           neither shall any plague come near your dwelling.

11    For he shall give his angels charge over you, *
           to keep you in all your ways.

12    They shall bear you in their hands, *
           lest you dash your foot against a stone.

13    You shall tread upon the lion and the adder; *
           you shall trample the young lion and the serpent
                          under your feet.

14    Because he is bound to me in love,
        therefore will I deliver him; *
            I will protect him, because he knows my Name.
 
15    He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; *
           I am with him in trouble;
           I will rescue him and bring him to honor.

16    With long life will I satisfy him, *
           and show him my salvation.

      Psalm 134 Ecce nunc 

1    Behold now, bless the LORD, all you servants of the LORD, *
         you that stand by night in the house of the LORD.

2    Lift up your hands in the holy place and bless the LORD; *
         the LORD who made heaven and earth bless you out of Zion.

At the end of the Psalms is sung or said

Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit: * 
   as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.
