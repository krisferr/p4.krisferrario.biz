    <h4>The General Thanksgiving</h4>
        <em>Officiant and People:</em><br>
        <p>Almighty God, Father of all mercies,<br>
        we your unworthy servants give you humble thanks<br>
        for all your goodness and loving-kindness<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to us and to all whom you have made.<br>
        We bless you for our creation, preservation,<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the blessings of this life;<br>
        but above all for your immeasurable love<br>
        in the redemption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
        for the means of grace, and for the hope of glory.<br>
        And, we pray, give us such an awareness of your mercies,<br>
        that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise,<br>
        not only with our lips, but in our lives,<br>
        by giving up our selves to your service,<br>
        and by walking before you<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in holiness and righteousness all our days;<br>
        through Jesus Christ our Lord,<br>
        to whom, with you and the Holy Spirit,<br>
        be honor and glory throughout all ages. <em>Amen.</em><br></p>

    <h4>A Prayer of St. John Chrysostom</h4>
        <p>Almighty God, you have given us grace at this time with one<br>
        accord to make our common supplications to you; and you<br>
        have promised through your well beloved Son that when two<br>
        or three are gathered together in his name you will be in the<br>
        midst of them: Fulfill now, O Lord, our desires and petitions<br>
        as may be best for us; granting us in this world knowledge of<br>
        your truth, and in the age to come life everlasting. <em>Amen.</em><br></p>
    
    <br>
    <p><em>Officiant:</em>		Let us bless the Lord.</p>
    <p><em>People:</em>		<strong>Thanks be to God.</strong></p>
